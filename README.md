# what-else

A very basic tool for figuring out what else you could brew with the smallest amount of additional ingredients (by weight) added to a planned purchase

As an example, the included json files will produce output like this:

```
Already making: Old Ale
Could make: Oud Bruin
Need more:
	Tradition 0lbs 0.52oz
	Pilsner 2lbs 10.4oz
```
